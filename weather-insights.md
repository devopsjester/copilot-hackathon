# Easy Challenge: Build a Weather Insights Dashboard

## Goal:
Use publicly available weather data to create a simple dashboard that provides real-time weather insights for a specific location.

## Tools:
- **Databricks**: For data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Python Visualization Libraries**: Use libraries like Plotly, Matplotlib, or Seaborn for creating visualizations.
- **Data Sources**: Public APIs like OpenWeatherMap or NOAA.

## Key Features:
1. **Real-Time Weather Statistics**:
   - Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation levels.
2. **7-Day Forecast**:
   - Visualize upcoming weather trends using line or bar charts.
3. **Interactive Filters**:
   - Allow users to filter data by specific dates or weather conditions.

## Steps:
1. Fetch weather data from a public API and load it into Databricks.
2. Clean and preprocess the data to extract meaningful metrics.
3. Visualize real-time weather statistics and forecasts using Python libraries.
4. Deploy the dashboard for local or web access.

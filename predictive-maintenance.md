# Medium Challenge: Predictive Maintenance for IoT Devices

## Goal:
Analyze IoT sensor data to build a predictive maintenance model that identifies when a machine is likely to fail.

## Tools:
- **Databricks**: For data ingestion, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Spark MLlib**: For training machine learning models.
- **Visualization Libraries**: Use Matplotlib or Seaborn for feature and result visualization.

## Key Features:
1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Process IoT sensor data to detect patterns and anomalies.
2. **Predictive Model**:
   - Train a model to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of machines.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Provide a dashboard that visualizes prediction accuracy and key influencing factors.

## Steps:
1. Load IoT sensor data into Databricks and perform exploratory data analysis.
2. Engineer features like temperature trends, vibration thresholds, or operational cycles.
3. Train a regression model to predict RUL using Spark MLlib.
4. Visualize the prediction results, including confidence intervals and key feature impacts.
